# FreeAgent Timesheets

This script logs timesheets on FreeAgent. When I wrote this I was working on the same project for several months and didn't have to consider bank holidays or annual leave. FreeAgent automatically selects the current week and always uses the project that was used in the previous timesheet so I didn't have to update these two fields.
