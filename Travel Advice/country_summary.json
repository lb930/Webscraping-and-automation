For information on how to book, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/return-to-the-uk\">Return to the UK</a></p>\n\n<p>The Afghan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. For more information, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/staying-during-coronavirus\">Staying during coronavirus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since 19 March non-core British Embassy staff in Kabul, have been withdrawn from Post. Core staff remain to continue operational work.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is not available in parts of Afghanistan where the FCO advise against all travel and severely limited where the FCO advise against all but essential travel. The level of consular assistance the British Embassy can provide to travellers in Afghanistan is extremely limited. There are limits to the assistance the FCO can provide in a crisis, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy is not able to accept registrations from British nationals travelling in Afghanistan or monitor their safety when they are in country. Staff from the British Embassy may be unable to travel to certain parts of the country due to the security situation; this may severely limit the consular assistance that can be offered. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British Embassy doesn\u2019t allow official visitors to stay in hotels overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. Specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul. Follow the instructions of local authorities. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Take out comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel and medical insurance</a> before you travel. Make sure your policy covers you for travel in Afghanistan, noting any requirements for security and armoured vehicles. It may be difficult to get insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Afghanistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from powerful earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. The British Embassy can provide limited consular assistance in Afghanistan, particularly outside the capital Kabul. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 119 (police and ambulance) and 112 (fire).

You should limit your movements, avoid large gatherings and remain vigilant at all times.</p>\n\n<p>In Bujumbura you should avoid areas which have previously experienced violence. In particular Kanyosha, Musaga, Mutakura, Kamenge, Cibitoke, Bwiza, Ngagara, Nyakabiga.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark. This is due to the security situation and road safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda remains unstable, and there have been armed attacks. If you are travelling near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or Rwanda, you should be aware of the risk of attacks. You should exercise caution and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via local media and this travel advice.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>A small number of staff and dependants were drawn down from the British High Commission. The British High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Armed separatists imposed lockdowns in August and September 2019. During a lockdown in February 2019, there were reports of violence and loss of life. Urban transport in towns and cities was affected and vehicular traffic in and out of the region was restricted. Incidents of sporadic gunfire also occurred, including shooting in Bamenda, Buea and the outskirts of Limbe. You should monitor local media to check for the latest information about the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>General strikes (or \u2018ghost towns\u2019) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February, May and October. Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past year in many places in the North West and South West regions. In the first four months of 2019, clashes between the army and armed separatists were reported in the towns of Bafut, Tubah, Ndu, Widikum, Muyuka and in Lebialem, Momo, Bui and Mezam divisions. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, which were imposed following violent and deadly clashes in 2017, remain in place. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the FCO advise against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security\">North West and South West (Anglophone) regions</a></p>\n\n<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country, including Yaound\u00e9. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region and the eastern border with Central African Republic. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist group Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaound\u00e9 and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.\nBoko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon\u2019s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#crime\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/return-to-the-uk\">Return to the UK</a></p>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities continue to impose various control and quarantine measures across the country, including restrictions on movement, reduced transport, entry and exit controls for towns and villages, and isolation requirements for travel between different parts of the country. For guidance on how to stay safely in China as a visitor if you are unable to return to the UK, see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/staying-during-coronavirus\">Staying during coronavirus</a></p>\n\n<p>China has suspended entry to foreign nationals with visas issued before 27 March. The Chinese authorities have told the British Embassy in Beijing that this includes transit passengers. The only exemptions will be diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas. On 13 March, China issued a new order to ensure compliance with health and quarantine regulations at borders in order to prevent potential outbreaks from imported COVID-19 cases. For full information, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>Since 31 January, some staff and dependants from the British Embassy and Consulates have been withdrawn. Essential staff needed to continue critical work, including consular assistance, remain. British Consulates-General in Shanghai and Guangzhou will \u2013 for the immediate future \u2013 continue to provide essential travel documentary services to British nationals wishing to leave China (but no other consular assistance). The British Consulates-General in Wuhan and Chongqing are currently closed. The ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide face-to-face assistance within China is currently limited, and would be even more limited in the event that the situation deteriorates further. If you\u2019re in in China and need consular support, call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 or the FCO in London on +44 (0) 207 008 1500.</p>\n\n<p>You should always take out comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel and medical insurance</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals normally need a visa to enter mainland China, including Hainan Island, but not Hong Kong or Macao. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals over the age of 16 must carry their passport at all times. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>You must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau within 24 hours of arrival. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>China has a zero tolerance policy on drugs. There are severe penalties for drugs-related offences including the death penalty. Police often raid bars and nightclubs checking for the use of illicit substances. Raids on private homes have also occurred. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven\u2019t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attempt to travel to Tibet without getting the correct permits. The Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) can be closed to foreigners without notice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region</a></p>\n\n<p>Police have the power to detain or prevent you from leaving China if you\u2019re involved in or connected to a business and/or civil dispute. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>In light of ongoing protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong. This includes reports that travellers\u2019 electronic devices have been checked at border crossings. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>China doesn\u2019t recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter China on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The FCO has published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>. If you\u2019ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban and industrialised areas in China, and may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aqicn.info/city/beijing/\">pollution index levels</a> for many cities in real time. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/health\">Health</a></p>\n\n<p>The typhoon season in China normally runs from May to November. You should monitor the progress of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/\">approaching storms</a> and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/china/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries have caused high regional tension.

The Congolese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/staying-during-coronavirus\">Staying during coronavirus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently no further UK special flights organised from DRC.

See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/return-to-the-uk\">Return to the UK</a></p>\n\n<p>Given the rapidly changing situation in DRC we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in DRC.</p>\n\n<p>Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. You should follow local media for updates. In all instances, you should remain vigilant and be aware of disruptions to journeys. If a demonstration or disturbance takes place, leave quickly and don\u2019t attempt to watch or photograph it.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. The continued presence of armed groups, military operations against them, intercommunal violence and an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries all contribute to a deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings. NGO staff and Ebola response workers have been known to be targeted. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.</p>\n\n<p>On 17 July 2019, the World Health Organisation declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) following an outbreak of the Ebola virus in eastern DRC. If you are in these areas you should take precautions to minimise your risk of exposure. Further advice is available on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\">World Health Organisation</a> website. Public Health England\u2019s Returning Workers Scheme provides guidance for British nationals who will be returning to the UK from areas affected by the outbreak. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/health\">Health</a></p>\n\n<p>Street crime and robbery is common. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don\u2019t hail taxis in the street. Beware of gangs promising you cut price gold and diamonds.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/safety-and-security\">Crime</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the DRC.

There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Although most attacks occur in North Sinai, there is a risk of terrorist attacks across the country. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks. Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the advice of Egyptian authorities, remaining particularly vigilant and maintaining a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings. You can find a list of public holidays on the <a href=\"/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-cairo/office/british-embassy-cairo-main-contact\">British Embassy Cairo website</a>.

These types of incidents also happen along Route 60 within the West Bank (the main road connecting Jerusalem with Nablus and Hebron) and along Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There\u2019s a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Be especially vigilant and take great care at the Qalandiya checkpoint between East Jerusalem and Ramallah, in areas close to refugee camps, in and around Israeli settlements and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah. There have also been several violent incidents in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah).

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/staying-during-coronavirus\">Staying during coronavirus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently no regular commercial options available to return to the UK direct from Lebanon, due to the Lebanese Government\u2019s decision to close all borders.  The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Lebanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for British nationals to return to the UK as soon as possible. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/return-to-the-uk\">Return to the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Protests against the deteriorating economic situation in Lebanon, which began in October 2019, are continuing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, including most recently the Beqaa Valley and Saida, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred. This includes clashes in Tripoli on 27 April 2020 where a protestor died, and several protestors and members of the security forces were injured.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, banks have  closed, and there is a risk that supplies (including medical) may become increasingly scarce. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security#political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region.

You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges between Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling, most recently in 2019.   See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security#security-situation\">Security situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate.   On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli.  See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act \u2013 including funding and supporting proscribed organisations \u2013 may be liable to prosecution in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places.

This advice has been in place consistently since 2014. If you\u2019re in Libya against this advice, you should seek to leave immediately by any practical means.</p>\n\n<p>All travel to, from and within Libya is at the traveller\u2019s risk. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Libya\u2019s air, land and maritime borders are closed. Occasionally the Libyan authorities or foreign embassies organise repatriation flights to European countries to enable the repatriation of Libyan nationals based in those countries. If you would like information on these flights, email Tunisconsular.enquiries@fco.gov.uk. The FCO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual departure options, including these flights, or on travel to a departure point. You should make your own judgement about the safest route out of the country, taking account of the advice of local authorities. This may include curfews and travel restrictions as a result of the conflict and COVID-19 pandemic. In certain areas, e.g. where fighting is taking place, the best course of action may be to stay where you are until it becomes safer to move on.</p>\n\n<p>Consular support is not available from the British government from within Libya, as consular operations remain suspended. If you need to speak to a consular officer, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500 or email <a href=\"mailto:Tunisconsular.enquiries@fco.gov.uk\">Tunisconsular.enquiries@fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Inter-militia fighting poses significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Mitiga Airport, Tripoli\u2019s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery, most recently on 9 May 2020, and is currently closed. FCO staff do not travel by air to or from Mitiga. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security#air-travel\">Air travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Since April 2019, there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces in the west of Libya. Regular and heavy armed clashes continue to take place to the south and west of Tripoli. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. In August 2019, a car bomb explosion in the eastern city of Benghazi killed five, including three foreign nationals. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should consider your security arrangements carefully and take all necessary security precautions, including contingency plans. You should also take out comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel and medical insurance</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/libya/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.</p>\n\n</div>"]},

During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should consider whether you need to visit it.</p>\n\n<p>A nationwide state of emergency in place since November 2015 has been extended several times, most recently in October 2019 by one year until 31 October 2020.

Since 1 May, regular protests have taken place in Bamako and across the country following the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling on these elections. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local news.</p>\n\n<p>Recent public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence.

See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/return-to-the-uk\">Return to the UK</a></p>\n\n<p>Given the rapidly changing situation in Nigeria the British High Commission in Abuja and the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos have temporarily withdrawn a small number of UK staff and dependents. Both locations will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Nigeria.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 January 2020, a spokesperson for President Buhari announced the President had ordered air strikes in Niger state against criminal groups operating out of the Dogon Gona forest area bordering Zamfara and Kaduna states. Airstrikes are yet to take place in Niger State, however, helicopter gunships have reportedly been operating in Kaduna State targeting cross border banditry.   If you decide to travel to these areas of Niger state, you should follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The al Qaeda-linked terrorist group Jamaat al Ansar al Muslimeen fi Bilad al Sudan, better known as Ansaru, claims to have killed at least 6 people, kidnapped dozens, and destroyed several vehicles during an ambush along the Kaduna-Zaira highway in Kaduna State in mid-January. If you decide to travel to Kaduna State, you should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to only travel during daylight hours. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Following the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US strike in Baghdad on 3 January, the Nigerian Inspector-General of Police has placed his forces across the country on high alert because of an increased risk of public disturbance. The British High Commission is not aware of specific threats against British nationals, but you should continue to avoid large crowds and public demonstrations as they can turn violent unexpectedly and at short notice. If you become aware of any nearby unrest or disturbances, you should leave the area immediately. Be aware of your surroundings, remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since January 2018, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) has protested regularly in central Abuja and other cities. These protests, particularly in Abuja, have the potential to turn violent. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/safety-and-security#local-travel\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Nigeria. Most attacks occur in the north east, particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States. There have also been significant attacks in Gombe, Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Bauchi States and in the Federal capital, Abuja. Further attacks are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could affect western interests as well as places visited by tourists. You should avoid places where crowds gather, including political meetings, religious gatherings and places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, transport hubs and camps for displaced people. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Kidnaps can be motivated by criminality or terrorism, and could be carried out for financial or political gain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of kidnap increases after dark. The security environment in the north east has deteriorated since 2018 and there is a heightened risk of kidnap. Kidnaps in the north east have included humanitarian and private sector workers. There are also reports that Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are continuing to actively plan to kidnap foreigners. As well as in north-east Nigeria, extremist groups operate in some northern and middle belt states including Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Niger and Adamawa. If you\u2019re working or travelling in these States then you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism#terrorist-kidnaps\">Terrorist kidnaps</a> and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/safety-and-security#criminal-kidnaps\">Criminal kidnaps</a></p>\n\n<p>Before considering travel to areas to which the FCO advise against all or all but essential travel you should take professional security advice. Be vigilant at all times and keep others informed of your travel plans   If you\u2019re working in Nigeria you should follow your employer\u2019s security advice, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly. Consular support is offered in Nigeria although limited in areas where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above).</p>\n\n<p>UK health authorities have classified Nigeria as having a risk of Zika virus transmission.

Existing advice for  North Korea remains in place:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The FCO advise against all but essential travel to North Korea (DPRK)</strong></p>\n\n<p>All air and train routes into and out of North Korea are temporarily suspended as of 31 January 2020. Foreigners who have travelled into North Korea from virus-affected countries are subject to a 30 day period of quarantine and medical supervision. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/north-korea/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>Few British people visit North Korea.  Those that do are usually part of an organised tour.  If you decide to visit North Korea, follow the advice of your tour group and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your personal safety at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Offences that would be considered trivial in other countries can incur very severe penalties in North Korea, particularly actions the authorities deem to be disrespectful towards the North Korean leadership or government. A Japanese national visiting North Korea, as part of an organised tour group, was detained on 5 August 2018 on unspecified grounds before being released and deported on 28 August 2018. An Australian student resident in Pyongyang was detained in June 2019 before being released in July. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/north-korea/local-laws-and-customs\">Local laws and customs</a></p>\n\n<p>Some foreign nationals have not been granted access to consular support when detained in North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>In response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the North Korean government announced that all air and train routes into and out of North Korea were temporarily suspended with effect from 31 January 2020.  Consular support is not available from within North Korea as the British Embassy in Pyongyang has been temporarily  closed due to travel restrictions put in place by the DPRK government in response to the pandemic. Limited remote consular support is available by calling (+44) (0)207 008 1500.</p>\n\n<p>While daily life in the capital city Pyongyang may appear calm, the security situation in North Korea can change with little notice and with no advance warning of possible actions by the North Korean authorities. This poses significant risks to British visitors and residents.</p>\n\n<p>You should follow the political and security situation very closely and stay in touch with your host organisation or tour operator.</p>\n\n<p>The level of tension on the Korean peninsula grew considerably in 2017 due to a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. On 21 April 2018, North Korea announced a halt to nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile testing, but since May 2019, has carried out a number of other missile tests.  These include the testing of submarine launched and short range ballistic missiles, which DPRK tested most recently in March 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Since the start of 2018, there has been  renewed direct contact between the North and South Korean governments, and between North Korea and the United States. On 12 June 2018, US President Donald Trump met North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. In a joint statement, North Korea reaffirmed its previous commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The Panmunjom Declaration, signed at an inter-Korean summit on 27 April 2018,  included a number of commitments to build inter-Korean ties and reduce military tensions. A second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, in Hanoi on 27 to 28 February 2019, ended without agreement.   A further meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un took place on 30 June 2019 at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas, in which the two agreed that working-level negotiations would resume within weeks.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, similar periods of diplomatic engagement have failed to be sustained. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests and a return to instability in the region. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises, notably those regularly held in spring and autumn.

The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines include measures to quarantine all passengers on arrival, either in a free facility arranged by the Government of Pakistan, or in a facility which the passenger will pay for. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the security situation in Pakistan has improved considerably following action by the Pakistan government and security forces. In 2018, there were an estimated 484,000 visits by British nationals to Pakistan. Most visits are trouble-free.</p>\n\n<p>Following a terrorist attack in Pulwama in February 2019, there are heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly across the Line of Control. Certain flight routes or airports continue to experience restrictions. You should check with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before travelling to the airport for any flight to and from Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Protests can take place throughout Pakistan with little warning and turn violent quickly. You should avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/safety-and-security\">Safety and security</a></p>\n\n<p>Some periods of the year may pose heightened risks. During holy periods/religious holidays, there is an increased potential for targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan. There\u2019s a high threat of terrorism, kidnap and sectarian violence throughout the country, including the major cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi. Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. You should be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including political gatherings and religious events throughout Pakistan, and <a href=\"/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">take appropriate security precautions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, airports, public transport, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>Pakistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from further earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters</a></p>\n\n<p>Consular support is severely limited in parts of Pakistan where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). Consular support is also limited in parts of Pakistan where High Commission officials require travel permission from the Government of Pakistan. Permission is not guaranteed. The British High Commission\u2019s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas. The Deputy High Commission in Karachi is temporarily unable to provide in-person services such as Emergency Travel Documents.

There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories can be fast moving, tense and unpredictable. You should be vigilant at all times and keep up to date with local media and travel reports. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places frequented by foreigners, and on public transport. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There have been repeated instances of rocket fire from Gaza, which may occur well beyond the Gaza border area; Israel has often responded by returning projectile fire into Gaza. If travelling in central or southern Israel, familiarise yourself with the safety actions that you should take in the event of a warning siren, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.</p>\n\n<p>There have been mass protests on the Gazan side of the Gaza/Israel perimeter fence since March 2018. These protests may continue for some time. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/safety-and-security#gaza\">Gaza</a></p>\n\n<p>There are significant tensions between Israel, and the Assad regime and Iranian military forces in Syria. On 21 January 2019, the Israeli Air Force stated that it had struck Iranian military assets in Syria, in response to missile fire towards the Israeli-occupied Golan. The situation remains fragile, and could change quickly. If travelling in the area remain vigilant, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are continued heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon. The situation on the ground could change quickly. On 1 September 2019 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line, with material damage but no reported injuries on either side. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/safety-and-security#border-with-lebanon\">Border with Lebanon</a></p>\n\n<p>Make sure you are aware of Israeli immigration policies before you travel. Allow extra time for increased security measures and checks at airports during Israeli holidays and during the peak summer tourist season. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/entry-requirements\">Entry requirements</a></p>\n\n<p>In Israel and the West Bank, including Tel Aviv, East Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly the Damascus Gate and Lion\u2019s Gate areas of the Old City) and Hebron, there have been numerous violent clashes between protestors and security forces and stabbing, shooting, arson, vehicle ramming and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These types of incidents also happen along Route 60 within the West Bank (the main road connecting Jerusalem with Nablus and Hebron) and along Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There\u2019s a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Be especially vigilant and take great care at the Qalandiya checkpoint between East Jerusalem and Ramallah, in areas close to refugee camps, in and around Israeli settlements and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah.There have also been several violent incidents in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah). Individuals carrying weapons have been arrested in Nablus.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth) and after Friday prayers and on religious holidays. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent.

There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia has been leading coalition air strikes in Yemen since 2015, following a request for support from President Hadi to deter continued Houthi aggression. Clashes along the Saudi-Yemeni border continue, resulting in both military and civilian casualties.</p>\n\n<p>Missiles, unmanned aerial systems (drones) and water borne IEDs continue to be launched against Saudi Arabia, targeting critical national infrastructure, including aviation interests and oil infrastructure. Many of these have been intercepted and destroyed by Saudi air defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks against critical national infrastructure are likely. Abha International Airport (Asir province) had been the target of a number of attacks in 2019. Attacks had resulted in injury to civilians and the death of one. On 14 September 2019, Aramco facilities, Abqaiq and Khurais, were hit by drones and missiles.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks may be made on other locations in Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh and Jeddah, and along the Red Sea coast. There have been 7 intercepted missile attacks over Riyadh since the first missile attack on 4 November 2017, the most recent on 28 March 2020. In the event of a missile attack, you should stay indoors, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.  See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/safety-and-security\">Local travel - Saudi Arabia-Yemen border</a></p>\n\n<p>All visitors, including pilgrims, need a visa to enter Saudi Arabia.  See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/entry-requirements#Visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia has suspended diplomatic relations with Qatar. All air and sea points of entry between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were cut on 6 June 2017. If you have a query relating to travel plans, contact your airline or tour operator. There are further restrictions on travel and residence affecting Saudi Arabian and Qatar nationals.

Follow local media and be alert to local and regional developments which might trigger public disturbances. Despite warnings issued by the authorities, demonstrations do take place from time to time. You should avoid protests or demonstrations. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/safety-and-security#Political-situation\">Political situation</a></p>\n\n<p>Due to security operations within the Qatif region of Eastern Province, British Embassy staff have been advised to travel within the region in daylight hours only. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/safety-and-security#Local-travel\">Local travel</a></p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Saudi Arabia. Attacks can be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. On 11 November 2019, a terrorist carried out a knife attack on artists performing on stage during Riyadh Season Festival, injuring four people. Opportunistic attacks on Saudi or western targets are also possible. You should be vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation interests. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Saudi Arabia to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin on these flights <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-uk-aviation-security\">have now been lifted</a>. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.</p>\n\n<p>Each year around 3.7 million pilgrims participate in the Hajj.

Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. Mines remain in this area from years of conflict.

Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.</p>\n\n<p>A ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since September 2018.  But a deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy, the ongoing peace process, or a more securitised response to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a serious deterioration in the security situation, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked, Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan\u2019s airspace.</p>\n\n<p>The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups.

Most visits are trouble free. Be alert to your surroundings and remain vigilant in crowded places popular with foreign nationals, including during festival periods.</p>\n\n<p>Without the current COVID-19 restrictions, British nationals travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes would normally be able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Turkish authorities have confirmed that any foreign nationals who outstay their visa, due to COVID-19, will not face any fines or penalties. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/entry-requirements#visas\">Visas</a></p>\n\n<p>Following the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US strike in Baghdad on 3 January, the incident has led to increased tensions in the region.

This has led to heightened tensions in border regions, including cross-border rocket and mortar attacks into Turkey, close to the border.

Terrorist groups, including Kurdish groups, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks could be indiscriminate. Most attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country, and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations. You should be vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/terrorism\">Terrorism</a></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey, including expressions of support on social media.

You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/yemen/email-signup\">this travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation in Yemen remains unstable. Fighting continues across the country, which has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and damaged key infrastructure. Access to food, clean water, fuel and medical supplies is difficult throughout Yemen. There is a high risk of being caught in indiscriminate gunfire or shelling.</p>\n\n<p>The operations of the British Embassy in Sana\u2019a have been suspended since February 2015 and diplomatic staff have been withdrawn. Consular support is not available from the British government from within Yemen. If you need to speak to a consular officer in the UK, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500.</p>\n\n<p>The British government can\u2019t provide any form of assisted departure to British nationals in Yemen. There are no evacuation procedures in place, in line with the FCO\u2019s longstanding policy on assistance in Yemen. The FCO has been consistently advising against all travel to Yemen and for UK nationals to leave Yemen since March 2011.</p>\n\n<p>The FCO can\u2019t offer advice on the safety of travelling to any potential departure point. You should therefore consider carefully whether you want to pursue any options that become available. You should use your own judgement to move towards a departure point only if and when you judge it is safe to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The UK government\u2019s ability to facilitate onward travel from countries in the region is limited and you\u2019ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Yemen.
