# Webscraping-and-automation

This repository contains webscraping and automation projects.

## Content

- **AOPA**: This project uses Selenium to scrape all airports and their categories (private, military etc) from https://www.aopa.org/. Each airport name is then used to obtain further details using the AOPA API.

- **FreeAgent**: Wrote a script which automatically filled out my timesheets for me.

- **Signature Flights**: Scrapes all US airports and locations from https://www.signatureflight.com/locations?region=us

- **Tableau Public Profiles**: Scrapes each viz, its views and the number of favourites it has received from a given Tableau Public profile.

- **Travel Advice**: This project scrapes the UK foreign travel advice website (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). I started by scraping the URLs for each country and used those to scrape the summary website.
