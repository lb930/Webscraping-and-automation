# Webscraping-and-automation

This repository contains webscraping and automation projects.

## Content

1. [AOPA](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/tree/master/AOPA): This project uses Selenium to scrape all airports and their categories (private, military etc) from https://www.aopa.org/. Each airport name is then used to obtain further details using the AOPA API.

2. [FreeAgent](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/tree/master/FreeAgent): Wrote a script which automatically filled out my timesheets for me.

3. [Signature Flights](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/tree/master/Signature%20Flights): Scrapes all US airports and locations from https://www.signatureflight.com/locations?region=us

4. [Tableau Public Profiles](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/tree/master/Tableau%20Public%20Profiles): Scrapes each viz, its views and the number of favourites it has received from a given Tableau Public profile.

5. [Travel Advice](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/tree/master/Travel%20Advice): This project scrapes the UK foreign travel advice website (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). I started by scraping the URLs for each country and used those to scrape the summary website.
