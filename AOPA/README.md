# AOPA

This project uses Selenium to scrape all airports and their categories (private, military etc) from https://www.aopa.org/. Each airport name is then used to obtain further details using the AOPA API.

## Files

1. [AOPA Airports by State.ipynb](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/blob/master/AOPA/AOPA%20Airports%20by%20State.ipynb) scrapes every single US airport listed on AOPA.

2. [AOPA API.ipynb](https://github.com/lb930/Webscraping-and-automation/blob/master/AOPA/AOPA%20API.ipynb) extracts additional information from the AOPA API. I have limited the results to a few columns in the output.
